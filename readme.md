This project aims to provide visual assistance using computer vision and speech technologies. It leverages object detection (YOLO), potentially depth estimation (MiDaS), speech recognition (Whisper), and text-to-speech (gTTS) to interact with the user and describe the visual environment or perform specific vision-related tasks based on voice commands.



\## üìã Prerequisites



Before setting up the project, you'll need a few essential tools installed on your Windows system.



1\.  \*\*Python:\*\* This project is written in Python. We recommend \*\*Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11\*\*.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Why?\*\* It's the programming language the code is written in.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Download:\*\* \[python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Important:\*\* During installation, make sure to check the box that says \*\*"Add Python to PATH"\*\*. This allows you to run Python from the command line easily. 



2\.  \*\*Git:\*\* This tool is needed to download (clone) the project code from GitHub.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Why?\*\* To get a copy of the project files onto your computer.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Download:\*\* \[git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

&nbsp;   \* You can generally accept the default settings during installation.



3\.  \*\*FFmpeg:\*\* This is a multimedia framework required by the `openai-whisper` library for processing audio during speech recognition.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Why?\*\* Whisper needs it to decode audio input from your microphone.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Download:\*\* Get the \*\*"essentials"\*\* build zip from \[gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Setup:\*\*

&nbsp;       \* Extract the downloaded zip file to a permanent location (e.g., `C:\\ffmpeg`).

&nbsp;       \* Add the `bin` folder from inside the extracted folder (e.g., `C:\\ffmpeg\\bin`) to your Windows \*\*System PATH\*\* environment variable. This allows the system to find the `ffmpeg.exe` program. (Search Windows for "Edit the system environment variables" to access this setting). 



4\.  \*\*(Potentially Needed) C++ Build Tools:\*\* Some Python libraries, notably `PyAudio`, sometimes need C++ tools to compile correctly during installation on Windows if pre-built versions aren't available for your specific Python version. It's good to install these proactively if you encounter related errors.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Why?\*\* To compile certain Python packages from source code if direct installation fails.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Download:\*\* Get the \*\*Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022\*\* from \[visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022).

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Setup:\*\* Run the installer and select the \*\*"Desktop development with C++"\*\* workload. After installation, \*\*restart your computer\*\*.

\## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions



Follow these steps using \*\*Command Prompt (cmd)\*\* or \*\*PowerShell\*\*.



\### 1. Clone the Repository



First, navigate to where you want to store the project (e.g., your Documents folder) and download the code using Git.



```cmd

:: Navigate to your Documents folder (or preferred location)

cd %USERPROFILE%\\Documents



:: Clone the project from GitHub

git clone \[https://github.com/trentnable/Visual\_Assistance.git](https://github.com/trentnable/Visual\_Assistance.git)



:: Enter the newly created project directory

cd Visual\_Assistance

2\. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is crucial for keeping project dependencies separate from your global Python installation, preventing conflicts.



DOS



:: Create a virtual environment named 'venv'

python -m venv venv



:: Activate the virtual environment

.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate

After activation, your command prompt line should start with (venv). All subsequent pip install commands must be run while this environment is active.



3\. Install Dependencies (Step-by-Step)

We'll install the required Python libraries in logical groups.



a) Core Computer Vision Libraries

These are essential for image processing and object detection. ultralytics includes torch (PyTorch) as a dependency.



DOS



:: Upgrade pip (good practice)

pip install --upgrade pip



:: Install OpenCV (for camera access and image manipulation) and Ultralytics (for YOLO object detection)

pip install opencv-python ultralytics

b) Speech Input Libraries

These libraries handle listening to your microphone and converting your speech to text.



DOS



:: Install Whisper (speech-to-text), SoundDevice and PyAudio (microphone access)

pip install openai-whisper sounddevice PyAudio SpeechRecognition

Note on PyAudio: If pip install PyAudio fails with a C++ error, ensure you have installed the C++ Build Tools (Prerequisite #4) and restarted your PC. Then try installing PyAudio again.



c) Speech Output Libraries

These libraries convert the application's text responses into audible speech.



DOS



:: Install Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) and Pygame (for playing the audio)

pip install gTTS pygame

d) Helper \& Model-Specific Libraries

These provide additional functionalities needed by the main scripts or specific models.



DOS



:: Install Keyboard (for detecting key presses like 'm'), Sentence Transformers (for text comparison/understanding in objectify.py),

:: TIMM (used by MiDaS depth model), and PyPIWin32 (needed by pyttsx3 on Windows for older TTS engines, though gTTS is primary here)

pip install keyboard sentence-transformers timm pypiwin32 pyttsx3

Note: We install pyttsx3 here as a fallback/alternative TTS engine potentially used in older parts of the code, even though gTTS seems primary. pypiwin32 supports pyttsx3 on Windows.



‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

Ensure your virtual environment is active ((venv) is visible). Then, run the main script:



DOS



python headless\_main.py
